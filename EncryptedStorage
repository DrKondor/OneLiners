# So, you've got sensitive data that you need to protect.
# Maybe your financial records, perhaps a secret clown fetish -- whatever it is you're into . . .
# So, let's set up an "easy" to use encrypted storage area. 
# For this example, start by creating a file 64 megabytes in size:

dd if=/dev/zero/ of=BoringLookingFilename

# Now let's encrypt this beast. You'll be prompted for a password. 
# *WRITE IT DOWN* so you'll remember it, fool:

cryptsetup luksFormat BoringLookingFilename

# Use cryptsetup again to open the device. 
# This will create a 'passthrough device' under /dev/mapper/ which you can name appropriately:

cryptsetup luksOpen BoringLookingFilename CryptVolume

# Drop a filesystem on it:

mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/CryptVolume

# We need somewhere to mount CryptVolume at:
mkdir CryptMount

# Now mount it:  
sudo mount /dev/mapper/CryptVol CryptMount

# Save your sensitive data to CryptMount as tho it were a regular unencrypted device.
# When you're done, unmount it:

umount CryptMount

# Finally, close the damn thing (it's still accessible over at /dev/mapper/CryptVolume) 
cryptsetup luksClose CryptVolume

# . . . aand that's all she wrote. You can go on with your normal, unencrypted life, now, kids. :)
