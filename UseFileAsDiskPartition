# Create a file with, say, 64Megs of zeros
dd if=/dev/zero of=imagefile bs=1m count=64

# Drop a filesystem on it. I'm using ext4 but go nuts and use btrfs or whatever filesystem you want:
mkfs.ext4 imagefile

# Make a place to mount the file at:
mkdir mountplace

# Now you can mount the fucker. This is called a 'loopback device':  
sudo mount -o loop imagefile mountplace

# Add data, encrypt it, whatever. Just remember to unmount with:
umount mountplace
# when yer done.

# That's all folks!
