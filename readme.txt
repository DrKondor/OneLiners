8/18/2014 I finally started to decide to seriously learn git. So I'm starting off with some little one liners in the commandline that are useful to know but not really worth memorizing . . . 

So I figured its a good starting point.

Github kind of dumbs down git. My advice: If you really want to learn git, stick to the command line. On the other hand, github is incredibly easy to use for novices, and that's a start.
