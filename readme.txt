In here, you'll find a bunch of odd curiosities related to Linux. Basically just quick configs and workarounds that I've used on my oddball hardware. YMMV. 

github is kinda like free storage, and I know I don't really use it correctly. But it makes git easy enough for rubes like me. Someday I'll do an interactive rebase on this repo so it's better organized. But for now, I'm really not feeling that ambitious
